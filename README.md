My goal here is to Build a summit site from scratch, with focus on a mobile first design. take a peak at what i'v built [Live Demo](https://harlexkhal.github.io/Game-Developers-Global-Summit/). ðŸ˜Š

### Features implemented:
* Integration of style linters for CSS, web linters for html & Lighthouse for page optimization testing
* Responsive mobile view and web view design using css media-queries, flex-box, and grids
* Launched and deployed to github pages ([Live Demo](https://harlexkhal.github.io/Game-Developers-Global-Summit/))
* Implemented navigation menu on mobile with JavaScript events
* Dynamically load speakers section contents from JS objects
* Dynamically load navigation header from JS, for a single header to be used across all pages.

## Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flex and Media queries)
- Bootstrap styling (A popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.)
- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).
- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
The basic requirements for building the executable are:
* A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
* VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
* Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
